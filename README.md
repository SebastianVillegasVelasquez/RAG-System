# 📘 RAG System – Research Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based research assistant that allows users to ask questions about a set of documents about cancer and receive concise, context-aware answers.
The system leverages ChromaDB for vector storage, LangChain for orchestration, and Streamlit for an interactive chat interface.

## 🚀 Features

📂 Automatic loading of .txt documents
✂️ Smart text chunking for better embeddings
🧠 Semantic retrieval with ChromaDB
💬 Conversational interface powered by Streamlit
🔒 Context-aware answers generated by an LLM (e.g., ChatGroq)
