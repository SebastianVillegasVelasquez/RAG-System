# 📘 RAG System – Research Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based research assistant that allows users to ask questions about a set of documents about cancer and receive concise, context-aware answers.
The system leverages ChromaDB for vector storage, LangChain for orchestration, and Streamlit for an interactive chat interface.

## 🚀 Features

📂 Automatic loading of .txt documents

✂️ Smart text chunking for better embeddings

🧠 Semantic retrieval with ChromaDB

💬 Conversational interface powered by Streamlit

🔒 Context-aware answers generated by an LLM (e.g., ChatGroq(free-layer))

## 📂 Project Structure

├── modules.py             # Helper modules (loading, chunking, embeddings, etc.)
├── main.py                # Streamlit entry point

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/SebastianVillegasVelasquez/RagSystem.git`

`cd RagSystem`

`python -m venv .venv`

`source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🔑 Setup the Project

Go to the Groq website
and create an API key.

In the root directory of the project, create a file named .env.

Inside .env, add the following line and replace your_api_key with your actual Groq key:

`API_KEY=your_api_key`


## ▶️ How to use it

Run the Streamlit app:

`cd src`

`streamlit run main.py`


Then open the provided local URL in your browser to start chatting with the assistant.

## 📖 Example

User: What is cancer?

Assistant: Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells...

## Adding Research Documents

To use the RAG system with your own data, place your `.txt` research documents inside the **`documents/`** directory.

For example, you can add files such as:

documents/

│── what_is_cancer.txt

│── cancer_symptoms.txt

│── treatment_options.txt

Each document will be automatically loaded, split into chunks, embedded, and stored in the ChromaDB collection when you run the app.
