Diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are related to up to 30–35% of cancer deaths.[3][64] In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of cancer deaths.[64] A UK study including data on over 5 million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least 10 types of cancer and responsible for around 12,000 cases each year in that country.[65] Physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk, not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on the immune system and endocrine system.[64] More than half of the effect from the diet is due to overnutrition (eating too much), rather than from eating too few vegetables or other healthful foods.[citation needed]

Some specific foods are linked to specific cancers. A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer.[66] Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminant, causes liver cancer.[66] Betel nut chewing can cause oral cancer.[66] National differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to its high-salt diet[67] while colon cancer is more common in the United States. Immigrant cancer profiles mirror those of their new country, often within one generation.[68]
